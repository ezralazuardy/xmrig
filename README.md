# ü™ô xmrig

A custom configured xmrig CPU cypto miner that work best in linux cloud.

> This repository is based on the original xmrig [v6.15.0](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases/tag/v6.15.0) for linux.

## üëå Requirements

- Cloud / VPS machine with `linux` operating system (Ubuntu 18+ is recommended).
- Having minimal 1 core vCPU (2 vCPU is recommended).
- Having minimal 4GB RAM (8GB is recommended if the server is used for other process, e.g. web server).

## üì• Installation

### Automated

- Run `wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ezralazuardy/xmrig/main/install | bash`

> xmrig will be installed in `/etc/xmrig` directory.<br/>
> The script will automatically reboot your machine after successfully executed.

### Manual

- Install [git](https://command-not-found.com/git) and [msr-tools](https://command-not-found.com/wrmsr) on your operating system.
- Clone this repository to your Cloud / VPS in `/etc/xmrig/` directory (running `git clone` with `sudo` is recommended).
- Configure the miner by running `./config`.
- Run the boost script (usage read below) by running `./boost`.
- Run the 1GB pages enabler script (usage read below) by running `./enable_1gbp`.
- Run the clear cache script (usage read below) by running `./clear_cache`.
- Finally, start the miner by running `./start`.

> The current miner session can be viewed by running `./monitor`.

## üî® Command Usage

- `./config` will open the editor for miner configuration.
- `./start` will start the miner in linux screen session.
- `./monitor` will monitor the current miner session.
- `./boost` will apply a CPU register patch for your device (works on machine host only, virtual machine will not be affected).
- `./enable_1gbp` will apply a CPU 1GB pages patch (works on supported CPU only).
- `./clear_cache` will clear the cache in current machine (not recommended to be used when miner is running).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Since many Cloud / VPS provider prohibit any crypto mining activity in their platform, we recommend only to run 1 instance of this miner only on a single machine.

Highly recommended to set the `max-threads-hint` configuration to `50`. For more details, check out [here](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/blob/beta/doc/CPU_MAX_USAGE.md). Configuring the script to run with delay or scheduler is also recommended to bypass the cloud platform defend system for suspicious activity (if crypto mining is not eligible by their term of services).
