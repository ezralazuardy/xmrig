# ü™ô xmrig

A custom configured xmrig CPU cypto miner that work best in linux machine.

> This repository is based on the original xmrig [v6.15.0](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases/tag/v6.15.0) for linux.

## üëå Requirements

- Cloud / VPS machine with `linux` operating system (Ubuntu 18+ is recommended).

- Having minimal 4GB RAM (8GB is recommended if the machine is used for other process, e.g. web server).

## üì• Installation

#### Automated

- Run `wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ezralazuardy/xmrig/main/install | bash`

> Currently the script only support Ubuntu 18+ OS.<br/>
> The script will automatically reboot your machine after successfully executed.<br/>
> xmrig will be installed in `/etc/xmrig` directory.

#### Manual

- Install [git](https://command-not-found.com/git) and [msr-tools](https://command-not-found.com/wrmsr) on your operating system.
- Clone this repository to `/etc/xmrig/` directory (running `git clone` with `sudo` is recommended).
- Configure the miner by running `/etc/xmrig/config`.
- Run the boost script by running `/etc/xmrig/boost`.
- Run the 1GB pages enabler script by running `/etc/xmrig/enable_1gbp`.
- Run the clear cache script by running `/etc/xmrig/clear_cache`.
- Finally, start the miner by running `/etc/xmrig/start`.

> The current miner session can be viewed by running `/etc/xmrig/monitor`.

| `/etc/xmrig/monitor`     | Display the current miner session.                                                                                                 |
| `/etc/xmrig/boost`       | Apply a CPU register patch for 15% more miner performace<br/>(works on a real machine only, virtual machine will not be affected). |
| `/etc/xmrig/enable_1gbp` | Apply a CPU 1GB pages patch for 30% more miner performace<br/>(works on the [supported CPUs] only).                                |
| `/etc/xmrig/clear_cache` | Clear the cache in current machine<br/>(not recommended to be used when the miner is running).                                     |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Since many Cloud / VPS provider prohibit any cryptocurrency mining activity in their platform, it's recommended to only run 1 instance of this miner on a single machine.

Highly recommended to set the `max-threads-hint` miner configuration to `50`. For more details, check out [here](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/blob/beta/doc/CPU_MAX_USAGE.md). Configuring the script to run with delay or scheduler is also recommended to bypass the cloud platform anti-fraud system for suspicious activity (if cryptocurrency mining is not eligible by their term of services).
